# E-commerce Frontend 🌸

This is the frontend for an e-commerce platform dedicated to skincare products, developed as part of my internship. The website is designed with a soft, feminine aesthetic and allows users to explore and purchase skincare products through a clean and interactive interface.

## 🌟 Features

- **Responsive Design**: Fully optimized for both desktop and mobile screens.
- **Hero Section**: Eye-catching introduction with a soft-themed background and engaging CTA.
- **Product Catalog**: Grid layout showcasing various skincare items with images, names, and prices.
- **Shopping Cart**: Users can add and remove products from their cart.
- **Checkout Page**: Basic layout for placing orders and finalizing the purchase process.

✨ Note
This was my first time working on a complete front-end project like this. While I aimed to fulfill all UI/UX requirements, I couldn’t complete the full scope due to university exams overlapping with the deadline, but I've created something on my own as the instructions were also not clear to me and they slipped my mind. I’ve already communicated this with my team lead and I am willing to continue learning and improving insha’Allah! 🤍
